### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an OS enthusiast, mainly focus on the low-level stuff, like BSP, virtualization, system performance tunning and profiling, part of my works are as follows:

#### Virtualization

- A member developer of [ACRN](https://projectacrn.org/) project.
- A shared memory based NIC driver for inter-VM communication: [ivshmem-net](https://github.com/tw4452852/ivshmem-net).
- A KVM frontend VMM: [zvm](https://github.com/tw4452852/zvm), you could think of it as the [Qemu](https://github.com/qemu/qemu) alternative.

#### OS

- [tos](https://github.com/tw4452852/tos): A x86 based OS implemented from scratch.
- [zbpf](https://github.com/tw4452852/zbpf): A framework to write [BPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF) with [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig).

I'm also an active open-source contributor, you could find me in the following repositories:

- [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig)
- [Go](https://github.com/golang/go)
- [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)
- [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij)
- [Elvish](https://github.com/elves/elvish)
- [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [Aya](https://github.com/aya-rs/aya)
- [Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell)
- [Livebook](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook)
- [acme-lsp](https://github.com/fhs/acme-lsp)

I like to keep learning new languages by writing some hobby tools, e.g.

- [Countbean](https://github.com/tw4452852/Countbean): A [beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount) client written in [Dart](https://github.com/dart-lang) with [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter).
- [Cream](https://github.com/tw4452852/cream): A [Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) API frontend written in [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).
- [Barn](https://github.com/tw4452852/barn): A Fuse filesystem written in [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig).
- [zellij-pomodoro-plugin](https://github.com/tw4452852/zellij-pomodoro-plugin): A pomodoro clock [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) plugin, written in [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).
- I'm using [Acme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)) as my text editor, so some tools ([acme-dot](https://github.com/tw4452852/acme-dot), [acme-tag](https://github.com/tw4452852/acme-tag)) are written in [Go](https://github.com/golang/go).
